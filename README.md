# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Customer-Churn-Dataset

**Overview**

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for a customer churn dataset. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers cease doing business with a company. Understanding the factors influencing churn is crucial for businesses to retain customers and improve overall customer satisfaction.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this analysis includes information about customers and their interactions with the business. It comprises various features such as Internet services, Online Security, Online Backup, Total charges, Monthly charges and Tenure. The goal is to analyze this data and uncover patterns that may help identify potential churn indicators.    


**Exploratory Data Analysis**

The EDA is divided into multiple steps, each focusing on different aspects of the dataset:

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:

**Handling missing values.**

**Removing duplicates**.

**Descriptive Statistics:**

Overview of basic statistics for key variables.
Distribution of categorical and numerical features.

**Univariate Analysis:**

Histograms and other visualizations to understand individual variables.

**Bivariate Analysis:**

Investigating relationships between pairs of variables.
Identifying potential correlations and dependencies.

**Feature Engineering:**

Creating new features that might be useful for modeling.
Visualization:

Generating insightful plots to communicate findings effectively.

**Conclusion**

The findings from this EDA can serve as a foundation for further analysis and potentially inform strategies for reducing customer churn. Feel free to explore the code and visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset.

****Happy analyzing!** ðŸš€
